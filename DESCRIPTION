Description: Functions for causal structure learning based on the paper 
    'Causal discovery in heavy-tailed models' by Gnecco, Meinshausen,
    Peters, and Engelke, (2018) <arXiv:1908.05097>.
    Extremal ancestral search (EASE) is the main algorithm to recover the causal
    order of a heavy-tailed structural causal model (SCM). To compare EASE with
    other methods, we provide wrapper functions around LiNGAM-ICA, PC and 
    PC-Rank algorithm.
